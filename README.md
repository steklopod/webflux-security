# Spring Webflux + Spring Security + Kotlin Coroutines
## [![Minimal CI/CD](https://github.com/steklopod/webflux-security/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/steklopod/webflux-security/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Hi! If you are one of those people like me, that are trying to learn Spring Webflux with Kotlin and want to add Spring Security 
to a project, this repository is for you. As you probably already know, the documentation about using Spring Security with Spring Webflux 
if very scarce and if we add Kotlin on top of that, is even more. This lack of documentation has encouraged me to do this repository, 
I will try to explain how to make a custom security configuration based in JWT with Kotlin coroutines with a "close-to-real-world" minimal example.

There are few resources over the internet explaining this topic, but most of them have incomplete or incorrect information. 
I think that this is for two reasons: a poor documentation and young technology. So even trying to do it perfectly, I'm pretty sure 
I made lot of mistakes, if you find them (in the code or in the README), please make a pull request. Together we could make a better documentation for everyone.

I'm assuming that you have some knowledge with Spring Webflux (know what Mono and Flux is), so I will skip the explanation of Webflux, 
but I'm going to shed new light on how we can work with Mono and Flux with Kotlin coroutines in an imperative way.

# Try it

Go to 'Customers' menu section and try to login with:

`user@example.com` : `userPassword`

## 1. Stack

First things first, the stack we are gonna use is the following:

* OpenJDK 15
* Kotlin 1.4.X
* Spring Boot (Webflux + Security + Reactive Data MongoDB)
* Maven
* MongoDB 4.2 through docker
* Vue.js

If you take a look at the parent [pom.xml](/pom.xml) of the project, you will see that we are compiling to java 11 
but this project runs in a OpenJDK 15 JVM. This is because Kotlin does not support java 15 bytecode yet.

## 2. Project Structure

The project consists in two maven modules:

* `backend-server` (Spring app)
* `frontend-client` (Vue.js app)

And in two more folders:

* `.github` (CI/CD)
* `data` (MongoDB scripts to initialize the database)

## 3. Security

Spring Security Webflux (like his brother the Servlet version) it's all about filters, these filters are composed one after the other 
forming a chain. Every [ServerWebExchange](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/server/ServerWebExchange.java) (an exchange 
it's commonly known as an object that holds request and response, this concept exists in other places like undertow web server) has 
to go through this chain. Spring Security Webflux allow us to configure the chain ([SecurityWebFilterChain](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/SecurityWebFilterChain.java)) as we need and even 
give us the possibility to have more than one per path. 
The filter chain for Spring Security Webflux has the following order:

     +---------------------------+
     |                           |
     | HttpHeaderWriterWebFilter | (1) default

    +-------------------------+
    
    - Figure 1. Unless otherwise specified, filters with 'default' word are added by Spring Security -

Looking at the diagram above (Figure 1), if we want to implement a JWT based security for our API (our use case in this repository), we 
have to focus on two filters: [AuthenticationWebFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authentication/AuthenticationWebFilter.java) and [AuthorizationWebFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authorization/AuthorizationWebFilter.java), but let's start with the default configuration that Spring Security Webflux give to us. 
Also, you could find the order of the filters here: [SecurityWebFiltersOrder](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/web/server/SecurityWebFiltersOrder.java).

### 3.1 Default Config 

Spring Security Webflux configures the filter chain (see Figure 1) automatically for us in [WebFluxSecurityConfiguration](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/reactive/WebFluxSecurityConfiguration.java#L98), through [ServerHttpSecurity](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/web/server/ServerHttpSecurity.java) bean, 
if we want something else we have to add this bean to our application context and explicitly configure the chain through it. 
Here you have the default config (copy and pasted from Spring Security source code):

```java
/**
 * The default {@link ServerHttpSecurity} configuration.
 * @param http
 * @return
 */
private SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    http
        .authorizeExchange() // this add authorization
            .anyExchange() // for any request
            .authenticated(); // Spring Security will authorize only authenticated users
    
    if (isOAuth2Present && OAuth2ClasspathGuard.shouldConfigure(this.context)) {
        OAuth2ClasspathGuard.configure(this.context, http);
    } else {
        http
            .httpBasic().and()
            .formLogin();
    }
    
    SecurityWebFilterChain result = http.build();
    return result;
}
```
This method (`springSecurityFilterChain`) is only executed if Spring Security does not find a 
SecurityWebFilterChain in the application context otherwise, it will load the SecurityWebFilterChain provided by us. 
Apparently, it's look simple but this method do a lot of things behind the scenes, in fact configure a whole 
chain. For example, if our application has the following config:

```kotlin
@Configuration
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
class MyWebfluxSecurityConfig
```

...and we don't have OAuth2 added as a dependency, Spring Security is going to add an http basic and form login authentication (with the famous login page)
filters for all incoming requests, besides all others filters appearing in Figure 1 (headers, csrf, logout, etc).

But wait..., where does that `ServerHttpSecurity` bean comes from? This bean is injected by Spring Security through [ServerHttpSecurityConfiguration](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/reactive/ServerHttpSecurityConfiguration.java#L122) config class, that 
is initialized as follows (copy and pasted from Spring Security source code):

```java
@Bean(HTTPSECURITY_BEAN_NAME)
@Scope("prototype")
public ServerHttpSecurity httpSecurity() {
    ContextAwareServerHttpSecurity http = new ContextAwareServerHttpSecurity();
    return http
        .authenticationManager(authenticationManager())
        .headers().and()
        .logout().and();
}

private ReactiveAuthenticationManager authenticationManager() {
    if (this.authenticationManager != null) {
        return this.authenticationManager;
    }
    if (this.reactiveUserDetailsService != null) {
        UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager manager =
            new UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager(this.reactiveUserDetailsService);
        if (this.passwordEncoder != null) {
            manager.setPasswordEncoder(this.passwordEncoder);
        }
        manager.setUserDetailsPasswordService(this.userDetailsPasswordService);
        return manager;
    }
    return null;
}
```

...so apart from the http basic and form login (and the others), here we can see that Spring Security also, adds the HTTP response headers [HeaderSpec](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/web/server/ServerHttpSecurity.java#L3269), 
[LogoutWebFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/web/server/ServerHttpSecurity.java#L3762) (with logout page) and 
a [ReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/ReactiveAuthenticationManager.java) specifically [UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager.java) that extends 
[AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager.java), if you have been working 
with Spring Security Servlet this probably sound familiar to you. 

UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager needs a bean of [ReactiveUserDetailsService](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/ReactiveUserDetailsService.java) to be
able to perform the authentication (this service is used to search the user that is doing the authentication 
from database or an external service), adding a bean to your application context should do the trick, and you will have Authentication in your project.
Here you can see the final minimal configuration:

```kotlin
@Configuration
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
class MyWebfluxSecurityConfig {
    // Please don't use this on production, implement one by yourself
    @Bean
    fun userDetailsService(): MapReactiveUserDetailsService {
        return MapReactiveUserDetailsService(
            User
                .withDefaultPasswordEncoder() // deprecated
                .username("user")
                .password("user")
                .roles("USER")
                .build()
        )
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Explicit Configuration

So far so good, we saw what is doing Spring Security for us, also we know which order has the filter chain in Spring Security Webflux projects 
and what is the default configuration. At this point, we could say that **with ServerHttpSecurity 
bean we can disable, enable or setting ours filters instead of the default ones**. In this section, I will explain how we can explicitly configure our chain.

Previously, I mentioned that simply adding a method to our configuration that adds the ServerHttpSecurity bean to our application 
context we can start configure whatever we want. Imagine for example, we want to remove the default authentication filters, we can do it with the following code:

```kotlin
@Configuration
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
class MyWebfluxSecurityConfig {
    /*
        ServerHttpSecurity bean is injected by Spring Security, 
        see section 3.1 for knowing where comes from.
    */
    @Bean
    fun springWebFilterChain(http: ServerHttpSecurity) = http.build()
}
```

Doing that, we add our custom SecurityWebFilterChain to the application context, then Spring Security doesn't load the default one. 
We are getting the SecurityWebFilterChain injected by Spring security that only has the authentication manager, logout page and 
security header filters without any authentication or authorization filters.

:warning: **Please don't do this on production is only for educational purpose**

If a client makes an HTTP request to our API is gonna be able to do it without problems, we 
have no security at all. See 3.1 section if you want to remember the default config.

Now you know how to explicit configure the chain, let's add some security to our API!

### 3.3 Authentication

Spring Security supports authentication for incoming requests, and represents it with [Authentication](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/core/Authentication.java) type. 
This type is used to represent the entity (user or service) we want to authenticate (verify that the entity is who it claims to be).

Spring Security Webflux use the [AuthenticationWebFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authentication/AuthenticationWebFilter.java) for this purpose and 
it could be configured to do whatever authentication logic we want.

Looking closer to that filter we can see the dependencies that configure it:

![AuthenticationWebFilter Dependency Graph](/diagrams/authentication_web_filter.png?raw=true "AuthenticationWebFilter Dependency Graph")

Most of them are provided by default and here you could see the list:

```java
private final ReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver<ServerWebExchange> authenticationManagerResolver;

private ServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler authenticationSuccessHandler = new WebFilterChainServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler();

private ServerAuthenticationConverter authenticationConverter = new ServerHttpBasicAuthenticationConverter();

private ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler authenticationFailureHandler = new ServerAuthenticationEntryPointFailureHandler(new HttpBasicServerAuthenticationEntryPoint());

private ServerSecurityContextRepository securityContextRepository = NoOpServerSecurityContextRepository.getInstance(); // No session

private ServerWebExchangeMatcher requiresAuthenticationMatcher = ServerWebExchangeMatchers.anyExchange();
```

...basically an `AuthenticationWebFilter` would behave as an Http Basic filter. The only dependency that must be 
provided by the client of this class, is [ReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/ReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver.java). 
This interface resolves a [ReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/ReactiveAuthenticationManager.java) from a given context (ServerWebExchange in this case). 
**This manager holds the logic to determine if the given Authentication object is valid or not, usually to do that this manager could 
call a custom LDAP, database, etc.** In this repository we are going to implement our custom JWT based authentication, which means 
that a client receives a token after a successful authentication. For us an Authentication object contains the 
username and password of the user that we want to authenticate.

How we can do that? We need to convert a ServerWebExchange (the incoming request) into an Authentication object, who is the responsible to do this? 

To know that, we must know before which path a ServerWebExchange follows when arrives to an AuthenticationWebFilter. This could 
be seen in the source code of the `filter()` method of AuthenticationWebFilter:

```java
@Override
public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, WebFilterChain chain) {
    return this.requiresAuthenticationMatcher.matches(exchange) // (1)
        .filter(matchResult -> matchResult.isMatch())
        .flatMap(matchResult -> this.authenticationConverter.convert(exchange)) // (2)
        .switchIfEmpty(chain.filter(exchange).then(Mono.empty()))
        .flatMap(token -> authenticate(exchange, chain, token))
        .onErrorResume(AuthenticationException.class, e -> this.authenticationFailureHandler
            .onAuthenticationFailure(new WebFilterExchange(exchange, chain), e)); // (5.i)
}

private Mono<Void> authenticate(ServerWebExchange exchange, WebFilterChain chain, Authentication token) {
    return this.authenticationManagerResolver.resolve(exchange)
        .flatMap(authenticationManager -> authenticationManager.authenticate(token)) // (3)
        .switchIfEmpty(Mono.defer(() -> Mono.error(new IllegalStateException("No provider found for " + token.getClass()))))
        .flatMap(authentication -> onAuthenticationSuccess(authentication, new WebFilterExchange(exchange, chain))) // (4)
        .doOnError(AuthenticationException.class, e -> {
            if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
                logger.debug("Authentication failed: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        });
}

protected Mono<Void> onAuthenticationSuccess(Authentication authentication, WebFilterExchange webFilterExchange) {
    ServerWebExchange exchange = webFilterExchange.getExchange();
    SecurityContextImpl securityContext = new SecurityContextImpl();
    securityContext.setAuthentication(authentication);
    return this.securityContextRepository.save(exchange, securityContext) // (4.i)
        .then(this.authenticationSuccessHandler
            .onAuthenticationSuccess(webFilterExchange, authentication)) // (4.ii)
        .subscriberContext(ReactiveSecurityContextHolder.withSecurityContext(Mono.just(securityContext)));
}
```
![AuthenticationWebFilter Flow](/diagrams/authentication_flow.png?raw=true "AuthenticationWebFilter Flow")

1. Checks if the request match a given pattern (any by default). This is done by [ServerWebExchangeMatcher](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/util/matcher/ServerWebExchangeMatcher.java). 
If success, continue with step 2, if not skip this filter and continue the chain. 
2. Converts the request to an unauthenticated Authentication object (from the Authorization header by default). This is done by [ServerAuthenticationConverter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authentication/ServerAuthenticationConverter.java). 
If the converter returns an empty Mono, continue the chain otherwise go to step 3.
3. Verify the Authentication object provided by step 2. This step is done by [ReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/ReactiveAuthenticationManager.java). If the verification is not successful (an AuthenticationException occurs) execute [ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authentication/ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler.java) (step 5), otherwise go step 4. 
4. On authentication success:
    1. Save the Authentication object in the security context (session) (nothing is saved by default). By [ServerSecurityContextRepository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/context/ServerSecurityContextRepository.java).
    2. Execute [ServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authentication/ServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler.java) (continue the chain by default).
5. On authentication error:
    1. Execute [ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authentication/ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler.java) (prompts a user for HTTP Basic authentication by default).

This is the general algorithm that AuthenticationWebFilter follows, and in which we can customize all steps or keep the default ones that are handy for us. 
In our case, the steps that we are gonna replace are:

1. We want to authenticate users through a POST to `/login` endpoint, our matcher looks at the request and see if this pattern match. We can use the factory method `pathMatchers()` that [ServerWebExchangeMatchers](/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/WebConfig.kt#L71) provides 
to create our custom matcher. 
2. Our converter gets from the body a JSON with `username` and `password` attributes and creates an unauthenticated Authentication object with them. Done by [JWTConverter](/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/security/authentication/JWTConverter.kt). 
3. [AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager.java#L98) gets the principal (username) and the credentials (password) from the Authentication object created in step 2 and: 
    1. [AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager.java#L100) looks into the database if the user exist with [CustomerReactiveUserDetailsService](/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/security/authentication/CustomerReactiveUserDetailsService.kt), if exists go to step 3.ii, otherwise throw BadCredentialsException and executes ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler (step 5). 
    2. [AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/AbstractUserDetailsReactiveAuthenticationManager.java#L103) checks if passwords match, if so authentication success, if not throw BadCredentialsException and executes ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler (step 5).
4. On authentication success:
    1. Our project is just an HTTP API and by default should be stateless, then we don't want to create a session so skip it. Done by [NoOpServerSecurityContextRepository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/context/NoOpServerSecurityContextRepository.java).
    2. Execute our [JWTServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler](/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/security/authentication/JWTServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler.kt) that generates an access and a refresh token and put them in the header of the response.
5. On authentication error:
    1. Return unauthorized error. Done by [JWTServerAuthenticationFailureHandler](/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/JWTServerAuthenticationFailureHandler.kt).

We are following these steps customizing [AuthenticationWebFilter](/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/WebConfig.kt#L70), and our ServerHttpSecurity configuration looks like:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun configureSecurity(http: ServerHttpSecurity, jwtAuthenticationFilter: AuthenticationWebFilter): SecurityWebFilterChain {
    return http
            .csrf().disable()
            .logout().disable()
            .addFilterAt(jwtAuthenticationFilter, SecurityWebFiltersOrder.AUTHENTICATION)
            .build()
}

@Bean
fun authenticationWebFilter(reactiveAuthenticationManager: ReactiveAuthenticationManager,
                            jwtConverter: ServerAuthenticationConverter,
                            serverAuthenticationSuccessHandler: ServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler,
                            jwtServerAuthenticationFailureHandler: ServerAuthenticationFailureHandler): AuthenticationWebFilter {
    val authenticationWebFilter = AuthenticationWebFilter(reactiveAuthenticationManager)
    authenticationWebFilter.setRequiresAuthenticationMatcher { ServerWebExchangeMatchers.pathMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/login").matches(it) }
    authenticationWebFilter.setServerAuthenticationConverter(jwtConverter)
    authenticationWebFilter.setAuthenticationSuccessHandler(serverAuthenticationSuccessHandler)
    authenticationWebFilter.setAuthenticationFailureHandler(jwtServerAuthenticationFailureHandler)
    authenticationWebFilter.setSecurityContextRepository(NoOpServerSecurityContextRepository.getInstance())
    return authenticationWebFilter
}

@Bean
fun reactiveAuthenticationManager(reactiveUserDetailsService: CustomerReactiveUserDetailsService,
                                  passwordEncoder: PasswordEncoder): ReactiveAuthenticationManager {
    val manager = UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager(reactiveUserDetailsService)
    manager.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncoder)
    return manager
}
```
 
At this point we have been customized our authentication flow, how should we authorize users to use our APIs?

### 3.4 Authorization

Spring Security could be used to give permissions to our clients for use certain endpoints of our API, these permissions could be role based, scope based or both and are called [GrantedAuthority](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/core/GrantedAuthority.java). 
We give permissions in the authentication process, in the ServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler when we generate the tokens 
we have to add the roles in form of claims in the JWT (see [JWTServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler](/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/security/authentication/JWTServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler.kt)).

In our application, we have three types of endpoints where we want to restrict access: 

1. **The public ones:** endpoints that serves static files and `/login` endpoint. 
2. **The private ones:**
    1. `/admin/**`: where only admin users can access, which means, clients that request our API with JWT that holds the admin role.
    2. **the rest**: where registered and admin users can access, which means, clients that request our API with JWT that are issued by us.

Spring Security Webflux has an interface that could be used to do authorization, this interface is: [ReactiveAuthorizationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authorization/ReactiveAuthorizationManager.java) and 
is used to determine if an Authentication object has access to a specific endpoint. So basically, we have to implement our custom 
ReactiveAuthorizationManager and configure our chain with it. Do you remember which method is the one that provides authorization config? If not here it is:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun configureSecurity(http: ServerHttpSecurity,
                      jwtAuthenticationFilter: AuthenticationWebFilter,
                      jwtAuthorizationManager: JWTAuthorizationManager,
                      jwtService: JWTService): SecurityWebFilterChain {
    return http
            .csrf().disable()
            .logout().disable()
            .authorizeExchange() // Configures authorization, now we can start adding matchers
            .pathMatchers(*EXCLUDED_PATHS).permitAll() // Matcher that allow requests to EXCLUDED_PATHS
            .pathMatchers("/admin/**").access(JWTRoleAuthorizationManager(jwtService, "ADMIN")) // Matcher to admin access only
            .anyExchange().access(jwtAuthorizationManager) // Matcher that adds an access rule manager for any request
            .and()
            .addFilterAt(jwtAuthenticationFilter, SecurityWebFiltersOrder.AUTHENTICATION)
            .securityContextRepository(NoOpServerSecurityContextRepository.getInstance()) // we don't store sessions
            .build()
    }
```

With this configuration (see [WebConfig](https://github.com/soasada/kotlin-coroutines-webflux-security/blob/master/backend-server/src/main/kotlin/com/popokis/backend_server/application/WebConfig.kt)) we are adding an [AuthorizationWebFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authorization/AuthorizationWebFilter.java) 
to our chain, the important thing here is that Spring Security creates it (see [ServerHttpSecurity](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/web/server/ServerHttpSecurity.java#L2587)) with a [DelegatingReactiveAuthorizationManager](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authorization/DelegatingReactiveAuthorizationManager.java) that holds a 
ReactiveAuthorizationManager (the one who determines if the client has access or not) for each path matcher we configured: one for the excluded paths, one for admin path and another for the rest. 
Each ReactiveAuthorizationManager is called when an endpoint match, so the `permitAll()` method is a ReactiveAuthorizationManager that always allow access, and the 
others are our custom ReactiveAuthorizationManagers:

```kotlin
@Component
class JWTAuthorizationManager(private val jwtService: JWTService) : JWTReactiveAuthorizationManager {
    override suspend fun getJwtService(): JWTService {
        return jwtService
    }

    override suspend fun doAuthorization(jwtToken: DecodedJWT): AuthorizationDecision {
        return AuthorizationDecision(true)
    }
}

class JWTRoleAuthorizationManager(private val jwtService: JWTService, private val role: String) : JWTReactiveAuthorizationManager {
    override suspend fun getJwtService(): JWTService {
        return jwtService
    }

    override suspend fun doAuthorization(jwtToken: DecodedJWT): AuthorizationDecision {
        return AuthorizationDecision(jwtService.getRoles(jwtToken).any { it.authority == "ROLE_$role" })
    }
}

interface JWTReactiveAuthorizationManager : ReactiveAuthorizationManager<AuthorizationContext> {

    override fun check(authentication: Mono<Authentication>?, context: AuthorizationContext?): Mono<AuthorizationDecision> = mono {
        val notAuthorized = AuthorizationDecision(false)
        val exchange = context?.exchange ?: return@mono notAuthorized
        val authHeader = exchange.request.headers.getFirst(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION) ?: return@mono notAuthorized

        if (!authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
            return@mono notAuthorized
        }

        try {
            return@mono doAuthorization(getJwtService().decodeAccessToken(authHeader))
        } catch (e: Throwable) {
            return@mono notAuthorized
        }
    }

    suspend fun getJwtService(): JWTService
    suspend fun doAuthorization(jwtToken: DecodedJWT): AuthorizationDecision
}
``` 

If you look at the code, you can see that we are not using the Authentication object for nothing, this is because we are not creating any session in the 
server, looking at the [AuthorizationWebFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/authorization/AuthorizationWebFilter.java#L46) 
we can see that is using the security context to get the Authentication from there but we disabled sessions so there is no Authentication object, we have to authorize from 
the request that is inside the AuthorizationContext.

To authorize admins, we check if the role that comes from the token in the request has the same role of the required, `ROLE_ADMIN` in this case.

To authorize the rest, we are checking the validity of the JWT that comes in every request. The validity for us is:

1. If the token is expired. 
2. If token was given by us (is signed with our signature).

These checks are provided by our JWT library. 

## Build project

1. Build frontend

`mvn -U clean install -pl :frontend-client`

2. Build backend

`mvn -U clean test package -pl :backend-server`

## MongoDB Index creation

Index creation must be *explicitly* enabled, since Spring Data MongoDB version 3.0, to prevent undesired effects with collection lifecyle and performance impact. In our project when we add a new `@Document` class, if this document class has any index, this index should be created manual. See [002_create_customer_collection.js](/mongo/002_create_customer_collection.js) for more info.

## Run hot reloading frontend

:warning: Before running the hot reloading frontend you have to build the frontend:

`mvn -U clean install -pl :frontend-client`

Then:

`bash frontend-client/npm --prefix frontend-client run serve`
